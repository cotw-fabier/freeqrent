# Roadmap

Ideas for future waves that **haven't landed in `SPEC.md` yet**. When an idea is taken up, it moves into the spec (and out of this file) as part of a wave. Milestones that are already planned live in `SPEC.md` §12, and finished work lives in `docs/waves/LOG.md`.

Each item says where it came from, so we remember why it's here.

## Output formats

- **PNG/raster export:** an optional crate on top of resvg. Deferred 2026-10-25 to stay focused on SVG.
- **Lottie export** from `AnimationPlan`. Deferred 2026-10-25.
- **Android VectorDrawable / AnimatedVectorDrawable** export. Deferred 2026-10-25.
- **SMIL fallback** for animation, for environments that ignore CSS animation in SVG (SPEC §8.4).

## Encoding

- **Micro QR:** the small symbol format (M1–M4). Stretch goal from SPEC §3.1.
- **Structured Append:** one payload split across up to 16 symbols. Deferred because phone camera support is poor.
- **rMQR (rectangular Micro QR):** the strip format from the ISO 18004:2024 extension, for long thin placements.

## Layouts

- **Multi-code layouts:** several redundant mini codes in a row or grid for wide or curved surfaces (the original reading of feature 7, deferred in favor of art mode).

## Styles and motion

- **Extended intro presets:** `Bloom`, `Rain`, `Spiral`, `Ink`, `Glitch`, `Typeset` (SPEC §8.3, extended set).
- **Extra module glyphs:** `Diamond`, `Star`, `Plus`, … (SPEC §7.1).
- **`Morph` transition:** cross-fade between two shape styles of the same code (SPEC §8.3).

## Bindings

- **Native Node build via `napi-rs`**, if WASM performance isn't enough (SPEC §10.2).
- **Swift, Kotlin, and C# packages** over the C ABI.
